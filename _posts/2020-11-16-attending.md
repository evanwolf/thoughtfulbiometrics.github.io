## Who is coming to the event?

We have invited a range of experts from diverse fields to the event. 

This event doesn’t have “speakers” because we don’t have pre-planned sessions. They are all experts in their respective fields and will likely convene sessions. 

**Here are some of the people who have agreed to participate.**
