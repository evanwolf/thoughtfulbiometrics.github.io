This event uses a format called [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) and is modeled after the [Internet Identity Workshop](https://internetidentityworkshop.com/).

The format is over 3 decades old and was innovated to support “alive” conversations that are inspiring and action oriented.

Each day of the event Feb 1, 3 and 5. Participants will gather in the main room of the event and any one attending can name a topic they would like to discuss, presentation they would like to share or question they would like to have answers to.  These session conveners will then pick a time and space for that session to happen.

There will be three time slots each day for an hour each with a 15 min break in between them.
